Clouds yield near-zero\nresidual values and strongly negative residual values can be\nindicative of the presence of non-absorbing aerosols including\nsulfate aerosols.\n\nUnlike satellite-based aerosol optical thickness\nmeasurements, AAI can also be calculated in the presence of clouds\nso that daily, global coverage is possible. This is ideal for tracking\nthe evolution of episodic aerosol plumes consisting of desert dust,\nash from volcanic eruptions, and smoke from biomass burning.\n\nSee further details in the\n[ATBD](https://sentinel.esa.int/documents/247904/2476257/Sentinel-5P-TROPOMI-ATBD-UV-Aerosol-Index.pdf).\n",

Clouds yield near-zero\nresidual values and strongly negative residual values can be\nindicative of the presence of non-absorbing aerosols including\nsulfate aerosols.\n\nUnlike satellite-based aerosol optical thickness\nmeasurements, AAI can also be calculated in the presence of clouds\nso that daily, global coverage is possible. This is ideal for tracking\nthe evolution of episodic aerosol plumes consisting of desert dust,\nash from volcanic eruptions, and smoke from biomass burning.\n\nSee further details in the\n[ATBD](https://sentinel.esa.int/documents/247904/2476257/Sentinel-5P-TROPOMI-ATBD-UV-Aerosol-Index.pdf).\n",

A general interpretation of atmospheric\nopacity is that values (after scaling by 0.001 is applied)\nless than 0.1 are clear, 0.1-0.3 are average,\nand values greater than 0.3 indicate haze or other cloud situations.\nSR values from pixels with high atmospheric opacity will be less reliable,\nespecially under high solar zenith angle conditions.

This type of loss should\ngenerally create a trend in the spectral signal(s) (e.g. NDVI\ndecreasing, Wetness decreasing; SWIR increasing; etc.) however the\ntrend can be subtle.  Structural decline occurs in woody vegetation\nenvironments, most likely from insects, disease, drought, acid rain,\netc. Structural decline can include defoliation events that do not\nresult in mortality such as in Gypsy moth and spruce budworm\ninfestations which may recover within 1 or 2 years.\n\n* Spectral Decline - A plot where the spectral signal shows a trend in\none or more of the spectral bands or indices (e.g. NDVI decreasing,\nWetness decreasing; SWIR increasing; etc.). Examples include cases\nwhere: a) non-forest/non-woody vegetation shows a trend suggestive of\ndecline (e.g. NDVI decreasing, Wetness decreasing; SWIR increasing;\netc.), or b) where woody vegetation shows a decline trend which is not\nrelated to the loss of woody vegetation, such as when mature tree\ncanopies close resulting in increased shadowing, when species\ncomposition changes from conifer to hardwood, or when a dry period (as\nopposed to stronger, more acute drought) causes an apparent decline in\nvigor, but no loss of woody material or leaf area.\n",

            "Raw LCMS modeled probability of Slow Loss. Defined as: Slow Loss includes the following\nclasses from the TimeSync change process interpretation-\n\n  * Structural Decline - Land where trees or other woody vegetation is physically altered by\n  unfavorable growing conditions brought on by non-anthropogenic or non-mechanical factors.\n  This type of loss should generally create a trend in the spectral signal(s) (e.g. NDVI\n  decreasing, Wetness decreasing; SWIR increasing; etc.) however the trend can be subtle.\n  Structural decline occurs in woody vegetation environments, most likely from insects,\n  disease, drought, acid rain, etc. Structural decline can include defoliation events that do\n  not result in mortality such as in Gypsy moth and spruce budworm infestations which may\n  recover within 1 or 2 years.\n\n  * Spectral Decline - A plot where the spectral signal shows a\n  trend in one or more of the spectral bands or indices (e.g. NDVI decreasing, Wetness\n  decreasing; SWIR increasing; etc.). Examples include cases where: a) non-forest/non-woody\n  vegetation shows a trend suggestive of decline (e.g. NDVI decreasing, Wetness decreasing;\n  SWIR increasing; etc.), or b) where woody vegetation shows a decline trend which is not\n  related to the loss of woody vegetation, such as when mature tree canopies close resulting\n  in increased shadowing, when species composition changes from conifer to hardwood, or when\n  a dry period (as opposed to stronger, more acute drought) causes an apparent decline in\n  vigor, but no loss of woody material or leaf area.\n",
            "Raw LCMS modeled probability of Fast Loss. Defined as: Fast Loss includes the following\nclasses from the TimeSync change process interpretation-\n\n* Fire - Land altered by fire, regardless of the cause of the ignition (natural or\nanthropogenic), severity, or land use.\n\n* Harvest - Forest land where trees, shrubs or other vegetation have been severed or removed\nby anthropogenic means. Examples include clearcutting, salvage logging after fire or insect\noutbreaks, thinning and other forest management prescriptions (e.g. shelterwood/seedtree\nharvest).\n\n* Mechanical - Non-forest land where trees, shrubs or other vegetation has been mechanically\nsevered or removed by chaining, scraping, brush sawing, bulldozing, or any other methods of\nnon-forest vegetation removal.\n\n* Wind/ice - Land (regardless of use) where vegetation is altered by wind from hurricanes,\ntornados, storms and other severe weather events including freezing rain from ice\nstorms.\n\n* Hydrology - Land where flooding has significantly altered woody cover or other Land cover\nelements regardless of land use (e.g. new mixtures of gravel and vegetation in and around\nstreambeds after a flood).\n\n* Debris - Land (regardless of use) altered by natural material movement associated with\nlandslides, avalanches, volcanos, debris flows, etc.\n\n* Other - Land (regardless of use) where the spectral trend or other supporting evidence\nsuggests a disturbance or change event has occurred but the definitive cause cannot be\ndetermined or the type of change fails to meet any of the change process categories defined\nabove.\n",
            "Raw LCMS modeled probability of Gain. Defined as: Land exhibiting an increase in vegetation\ncover due to growth and succession over one or more years. Applicable to any areas that may\nexpress spectral change associated with vegetation regrowth. In developed areas, growth can\nresult from maturing vegetation and/or newly installed lawns and landscaping. In forests,\ngrowth includes vegetation growth from bare ground, as well as the over topping of\nintermediate and co-dominate trees and/or lower-lying grasses and shrubs. Growth/Recovery\nsegments recorded following forest harvest will likely transition through different land\ncover classes as the forest regenerates. For these changes to be considered growth/recovery,\nspectral values should closely adhere to an increasing trend line (e.g. a positive slope\nthat would, if extended to ~20 years, be on the order of .10 units of NDVI) which persists\nfor several years.\n",

            "Pressure (force per unit area) of the atmosphere on the surface of\nland, sea and in-land water. It is a measure of the weight of all the\nair in a column vertically above the area of the Earth's surface\nrepresented at a fixed point. Surface pressure is often used in\ncombination with temperature to calculate air density. The strong\nvariation of pressure with altitude makes it difficult to see the low\nand high pressure systems over mountainous areas, so mean sea level\npressure, rather than surface pressure, is normally used for this\npurpose. The units of this variable are Pascals (Pa). Surface\npressure is often measured in hPa and sometimes is presented\nin the old units of millibars, mb (1 hPa = 1 mb = 100 Pa).\n",

Precipitation variables do not include fog, dew or\nthe precipitation that evaporates in the atmosphere before it lands at\nthe surface of the Earth. This variable is accumulated from the\nbeginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The\nunits of precipitation are depth in meters.
